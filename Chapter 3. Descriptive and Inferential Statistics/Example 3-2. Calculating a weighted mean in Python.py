üîç Step-by-Step Explanation:
zip(sample, weights)
Pairs each score with its corresponding weight:

[(90, 0.20), (80, 0.20), (63, 0.20), (87, 0.40)]
s * w for s, w in zip(...)
Multiplies each score s by its weight w:

[18.0, 16.0, 12.6, 34.8]
sum(...)
Sums up the weighted scores:

18.0 + 16.0 + 12.6 + 34.8 = 81.4
sum(weights)
Adds up the weights:

0.20 + 0.20 + 0.20 + 0.40 = 1.0
Division:
Divides the weighted score total by the total weight:

81.4 / 1.0 = 81.4
