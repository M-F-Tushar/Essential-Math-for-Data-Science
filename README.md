# 📘 Essential Math for Data Science – Code & Notes

Welcome! This repository contains my personal code, notes, and exercises as I work through **"Essential Math for Data Science" by Thomas Nield**. The goal is to strengthen my understanding of the core math concepts that power machine learning and data science.

## 📚 About the Book

*Essential Math for Data Science* is a practical guide that covers key mathematical concepts such as:

- Linear Algebra
- Calculus
- Probability & Statistics
- Descriptive & Inferential Statistics
- Optimization
- Graph Theory

It bridges the gap between theory and application, helping readers apply math directly to real-world data science problems.

## 🔍 What's Inside

Each chapter in the book has a corresponding folder in this repo with:

- ✅ Code implementations (Python)
- 📝 Personal notes and summaries
- 💡 Solutions to exercises (where applicable)
- 📊 Visualizations to understand key concepts

## 📁 Structure


> ✅ Each folder includes Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts that walk through the concepts and implementations.

## 🎯 Goal

This project helps me:
- Reinforce essential math knowledge
- Practice implementing mathematical concepts in Python
- Share what I learn with others in the community
